# Distributed-Systems-I

These are projects from my Distributed Systems course.  The programs were created in java, and compiled via javac and executed at the cmd line in Windows.  Each folder is of a specific project, with all projects focused on client/server programs.  

Each project should have a checklist (with the exception of the HostServer) plus light javadocs at the beginning of each java file.
