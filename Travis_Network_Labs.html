<h3> My One Page Writeup: </h3>

I installed the Windows 64 bit Wireshark on my Windows 8.1 computer.
Afterwards, I began the into lab. I searched the gaia.cs link and reviewed the data
that the questions asked about. <p>

I worked on the IP lab.  The lab writeup vs. my actual experience
were a little different.  Most likely due to versioning. I initially
looked one of the default addresses in pingplotter (google) but 
soon found out the format returned in Wireshark for that type of
website was much different than say reed.cs.depaul.edu. So I ended
up using that website to work through the problems in the lab. <p>

Then I worked through the DNS lab.  Again the results from the lab vs. my queries were
a little different. For instance the writeup still seems be under the assumption that 
only ipv4 exists.  When it told me to filter my requests, I put in my ipv4 address
into Wireshark, but quickly had to remove it as Wireshark was picking up my ipv6
address which is much different than the "typical" ip address. I used ipconfig to 
find out information and history for my computer, then I flushed it and cleared
my browser history in order to begin packet capture by Wireshark. I worked through 
the questions in the lab and compared looking up a web server via a browser, via
standard nslookup, and via nslookup -type=NS. <p>

For the HTTP lab, I cleared my browsing history and visited a couple different websites. 
I compared a website that updated its page every minute versus a static page and revisted
both pages multiple times to understand what happens when a page has not been modified. 
Then I worked on browsing for longer html text and learned how TCP needs to split up longer
messages over multiple packets. Next, I needed to browse for html pages with embedded objects,
in this case, pictures. The website only loaded on page, so I ended up going to other web 
pages with pictures. I moved on to the authentication part of the lab where I entered in 
a username and password to access the site. Was extremely surprised to find that I could 
converted the username and password to the ASCII characters by converting the Base64 characters
from the sniffer. Finally as I was working through each section, I answered all of the
questions.  It was helpful specifically see all of the different responses you could get
(no pun intended) from the server (OK, Moved Permanently, Found, Unauthorized, etc.). <p>

With the TCP lab, I first started by uploading a copy of alice.txt to the umass website to see
how the packet was handled when I needed to upload a file. From there I analyzed the SYN segment
of the TCP packets, the SYNACK, and the HTTP POST. Digging through the TCP segments to find the
POST command was a little difficult. After that, I looked up the Round Trip Time for some TCP
packets.  This part was a little quirky as I had to select another graph and then come back to 
the Round Trip Time graph in order for data to populate on the graph. I then looked up the time-
sequence-graph (stevens) on the packets. My graph differed from the one shown.  Where as he had more
packets of short height, I had less packets of longer height. I finished up the lab and worked through
the questions as I worked through the lab. <p>

The UDP lab was a much shorter lab than the rest.  I captured some UDP packets and worked through the
questions in the lab. It was a nice lab to show UDP as an alternative to TCP for lower-latency connections
between apps on the internet. Otherwise wasn't a particularly in depth lab. <p>

For my final lab in SSL, I ended up going to the Domino's website to purchase a pizza (because honestly 
their garlic crust is to-die-for). One thing I noticed of my traces vs. the book's traces, we're using a 
different protocol version. While they use SSLv3, I'm using TLSv1.2. I ended up reading up on TLS and realized
TLS offers a stronger key derivation process and is less vunerable. I worked through the questions from the lab
and learned how sending secure messages over the internet works (Client hello, handshakes, key exchanges, etc.) <p>
